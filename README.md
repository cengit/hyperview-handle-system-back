# hyperview-handle-system-back

#### 1. Run the example server

From the repo root directory:

```sh
yarn
yarn xmlserver
```

This will start an HTTP server listening on port 8085.

Then we can use http://192.168.18.94:8085 for hyperview page

#### 2. Start the demo app with android simulator

```sh
yarn android
```
